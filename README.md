# FreeCell
This is a very simple implementation of FreeCell that I made a while ago, hopefully useful to someone.

## Install

Just pull latest and run the "hybrid.java" file. You should launch a window with a new game ready to play.

## TODO

 - Unit Testing 
 - Still some hardcoded configuration options, these need to be refactored
 - Score Tracking
 - Some sort of message when you win/lose
 - Highlight on selection, this is frustrating now :(
 - Resizable Window
 - General code cleanup, I made this a long time ago, it needs to be reviewed
